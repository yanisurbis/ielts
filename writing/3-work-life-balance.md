Many people find it hard to balance their work with other parts of their lives. 
What are the reasons for this?
How can this problem be overcome?

It's well known fact that people spend most of their lifes working.
No secret that for a lot of them it's hard to find work-life balance.
In this essay I will try to look at the reasons of that and also provide some solutions.

One of the main causes of this issue is contemporary social media.
We always feel that we need to be up to date in our working field, to have personal projects & side hustles in order to present yourself in a good way publicly.
So instead of relaxing we overtax our sterngth and endurance which leads to depressions and burnouts.
The solution could be to tackle personal issues such as perfectionism, anxiety or confidence problems,
to have mental health on your priority list and limit your time in social media.
Individual and group therapy could be the option too.

Another problem could be an economical situation in a country.
For example Russia is experiencing an economical stagnation for eight years in a row.
This situation leads to highly unstable job market where people struggle to secure permanent employment,
so they are forced to please management with unbilled working hours in order to save their jobs.
The solution could be for a government to develop and execute good economic policies to bring economic prosperity back to Russia.

To sum up balacing work with other parts of your life is not an easy thing to do because of current economic and social environament.
This is a serious problem, and unless we can fix it, our personal lives and lives of our relatives will suffer.
My view is that responsibility for solving this problem lies with both the government and individual himself.
