These days, more and more people prefer to become at-home workers.
There are clearly many benefits to doing this, but people who work from
home can also face some difficulties.
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of escaping the office and working from home.
```

### Intro

- Nowadays, increasingly more people prefer to work from their homes rather than in an office.
- For many people the ability to work remotely is the key factor when looking for a new job.
- However, there are some downsides to going full-time away from an office.
- In this essay I will discuss some pros and cons of becoming an at-home worker.

### Content, Pros

- Let's begin by looking at the advantages of leaving an office job.
- One of the main positive advantages is cutting your commute.
- For some people going to work means to spend 1-2 hours daily on a train or a bus in one direction.
- Transitioning to a remote position will mean they will be able to save this time for themselves.

- Secondly, going remote allows many people to work and travel at the same time.
- For example, they can visit their parents in another town or a friend who studies abroad.
- For remote workers with a seasonal depression it is especially important. They are able to relocate to other countries to mitigate the effect of bad climate.

### Content, Cons

- Turning to the other side of the argument, it's hard to stay as productive as you were in the office settings.
- In other words, when workers go full time away from an office they are responsible for time management and setting up a distraction-free environment.
- For some people it can be hard or even impossible thing to do.

- Another issue is that remote workers can sometimes feel personally isolated.
- It's much harder to keep close relationships with a team and bosses when all communication is done through digital devices.


### Outro

- In conclusion, there are clearly both positives and negatives to working from home and not from an office.
- While transitioning to a remote position can drastically cut up an everyday commute, not everybody will be able to do that without losing their productivity.
- In my opinion, with the right amount of preparation, leaving an office job will be easy and you will never want to go back.
