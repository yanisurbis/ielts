Nowadays, increasingly more people prefer to work from their homes rather than in an office.
For many people, the ability to work remotely is the key factor when looking for a new job.
However, there are some downsides to going full-time away from an office.
In this essay, I will discuss some pros and cons of becoming an at-home worker.

Let's begin by looking at the advantages of leaving an office job.
One of the main positive advantages is cutting your commute.
For some people going to work means to spend 1-2 hours daily on a train or a bus in one direction.
Transitioning to a remote position could help them to save this time for themselves: maximasing time with your family, embracing a hobby or doing sport.

Secondly, going remote allows many people to work and travel at the same time.
For example, they can visit their parents in another town or a friend who studies abroad.
For remote workers with seasonal depression, who are fed up with long dark winters, it is especially important. An ability to relocate to other countries to mitigate the effect of bad climate is a huge win for them.

Turning to the other side of the argument, it's hard to stay as productive as you were in the office settings.
In other words, when workers go full time away from an office they are responsible for time management and setting up a distraction-free environment.
For some people, it can be a hard or even an impossible thing to do.

Another issue is that remote workers can sometimes feel personally isolated.
It's much harder to keep in touch with a team and management when all you have is online messaging and video conferences.

In conclusion, there are clearly both positives and negatives to working from home and not from an office.
An everyday commute could be drastically cut up because of the transition to a remote position, not everybody will be able to do that without losing their productivity.
In my opinion, with the right amount of preparation, leaving an office job will be easy and you will never want to go back.
