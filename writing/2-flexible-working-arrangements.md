permanent jobs towards various flexible working arrangements. What problems
can it cause and how could these problems be solved?

For many decades for a majority of people, work was something you do in a particular place in a particular time for a fixed amount of hours. Thanks to the commodification of the Internet and complex electronic devices things have changed. More and more people shift away from their 9 to 5 jobs to more flexible working arrangements. This essay will look at the problems such a shift creates and propose some solutions.

One of the issues that might appear is that transitioning to flexible working hours can blur the boundary between work and personal life. People will be more prone to overwork in case of upcoming deadline because they choose hours for themselves and don't want to disappoint management. The solution could be for an employee to be more aware of personal abilities to have more correct work estimations and clearly communicate this estimation to the administration.

Another problem could be that this transition will create a new group of employees who are less aware of their rights. A lot of employers are limiting the rights of their employees hoping that they can get away with it. The way forward could be for a government to develop some legislation to tackle such cases. Creating some educational programs for the workers could help too.

To sum up, the word is changing and work environment flexibility becomes a thing to have for an employer to acquire new talent. The number of workers with such benefits will only grow with each year and it will create some problems. But in my opinion, these problems are not comparable with the huge amount of benefits people will have because of this change.
